## Image Processing Using Deep Learning 
A part of machine learning is called deep learning. It makes
the machine ”learn” from a large amount of data and take
decisions to replicate the functioning of brain. Optimized accuracy
of the model can be achieved by adding multiple layers
to the neural network. Thus, Deep learning can particularly be
used in the area of analyzing medical images to improve
the accuracy and delay.There are various techniques to enhance images which include
filtering,noise removal, linear contrast adjustment, histogram
equalization etc. Implementation of these techniques result
in a better understanding of the images.
